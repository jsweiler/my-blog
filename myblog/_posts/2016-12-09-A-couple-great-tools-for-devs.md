### A couple great tools
I want to take some time and point out a couple great tools that make my day to day development easier. These work great for C# developers but are not limited to only C# as you will see. 

These are tools that make it very easy to quickly try out some little pieces of code and see the results

####.NetFiddle
For the first one all you need is your browser. [.NetFiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net) is a web application that lets you run C#, VB.NET, and F# code. For the project type you have the option of Console, Script, MVC, and Nancy. You can also enter NuGet package names as well.

It has the ability to AutoRun and I like using it for short pieces of C# code.
This picture will give you an idea of the functionality that you get.

You can also share fiddle's with others, for example [here](https://dotnetfiddle.net/IUiQ6Q) is the one that you saw in the previous picture.
Another thing you get is Intellisense as well!

You even have the option of viewing the IL! This definitely is a very handy tool if you like using browser tools.

#### LINQPad
[This](http://www.linqpad.net/) is another awesome tool for developers. Not only can you use the languages that .NetFiddle supports, there also is support for SQL as well!
Here's an image of a simple C# statement.

LINQPad has a free version but you also can upgrade to get more features which make it even more awesome. [Here](https://www.linqpad.net/Purchase.aspx) is a comparison between the different editions.

As a developer it is really helpful to have tools to play around with new ideas or experiment with code.

What related tools do you like and use often?
