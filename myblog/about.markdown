I've been a software developer since 2013. I started working on Windows Forms desktop applications, then moved on to WPF applications. I have since been working mostly in ASP.NET Core backend with some occasional working in Angular. 

I have a lot of experience using various Azure resources from Service Bus to Azure storage to Azure App Services and love to learn new things. I have more recently done more work with creating bicep and arm templates to automate the deployment of various resources in Azure.

While I mostly work in the .NET space I occasionally do some things in Python or some other language just to learn some more.
